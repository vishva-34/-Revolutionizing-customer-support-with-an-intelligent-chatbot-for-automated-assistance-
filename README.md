 A simple AI chatbot prompt design with code that uses natural language processing (NLP) to create a more conversational chatbot. We’ll use Python along with the spaCy library for basic text processing to improve understanding of user inputs. This chatbot will handle customer support queries like order tracking, returns, and product inquiries.
